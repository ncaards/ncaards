### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

More than 480,000 students compete every year and less than 2% of those make it to professional sports. From July 1st 2021 onwards, the NCAA is allowing students to capitalise their name, image and likeness (NIL). The athletes are going to have 999 limited tradeable NFTs, built under the Solana blockchain. Fans will be able to buy and trade them, with the possibility of making big profits. Simultaneously, they will be empowering the players economically.

The complete website files that were available from January 2022 - January 2023 at ncaards.com are uploaded in this repository.

Even though the project is currently at standby, the author intends to continue working on it in a near future.

Enjoy!
