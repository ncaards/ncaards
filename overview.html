                The NCAA has been taking advantage of college athletes for years. 
                More than 480,000 students compete every year and less than 2% of those make it to professional sports.
                Until last summer, students could not make money while competing.
                However, this situation has changed.

                From July 1st 2021 onwards, the NCAA is allowing students to
                capitalise their name, image and likeness (NIL).
                This is an unprecented era in college sports.

                We have got the opportunity to change the ways things are done.
                Every year, nearly $20 billion (and increasing) are made from college sports.
                The NIL era has just begun and we are afraid the money will still be shared unevenly between the players and the organisations.

                    All the athletes are going to have 999 limited tradeable NFTs.
                    These will be built under the Solana blockchain,
                    which is 4,000 faster than Ethereum and
                    has the lowest gas fees (averaging $0.00025 per transaction),
                    encouraging a continuous market flow.
                    It also allows the existence of different copies for each player.
                    Fans will be able to buy and trade them, with the possibility of making big profits.
                    Simultaneously, they will be empowering the players economically.

                There are 999 NFTs per player.
                However, these will not be available all at once.
                The moment a player makes its debut, a fraction of 
                its tokens will be available in the NCAARDS market.
                The highest bids will receive each token until 136 NFTs are sold.
                The first day of the month more tokens will be available for sale,
                but every time in smaller fractions. 
                <br><br> This will occur during the 4 years of the players' career.
                The earliest the NFTs are bought, the more profit the fans can make.
                Our objective is that the athlete feels the warmth and 
                support of the fans, who will be benefited from his / her progress.
